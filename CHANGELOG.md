## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The ability to "check" formatting by formatting the output of the first format.
- Comments can now be attached to the `case` keyword.
- Remove escaped forward slashes from regular expression literals when converting to `%r`.

### Changed

- Force a break if a block is attached to a `Command` or `CommandCall` node.
- Don't indent `CommandCall` arguments if they don't fit aligned.
- Force a break in `Call` nodes if there are comments on the receiver.
- Do not change block bounds if inside of a `Command` or `CommandCall` node.
- Handle empty parentheses inside method calls.
- Skip indentation for special array literals on assignment nodes.
- Ensure a final breakable is inserted when converting an `ArrayLiteral` to a `QSymbols`.
- Fix up the `doc_width` calculation for `CommandCall` nodes.
- Ensure parameters inside a lambda literal when there are no parentheses are grouped.
- Ensure when converting an `ArrayLiteral` to a `QWords` that the strings do not contain `[`.
- Stop looking for parent `Command` or `CommandCall` nodes in blocks once you hit `Statements`.
- Ensure nested `Lambda` nodes get their correct bounds.
- Ensure we do not change block bounds within control flow constructs.
- Ensure parentheses are added around keywords changing to their modifier forms.
- Allow conditionals to take modifier form if they are using the `then` keyword with a `VoidStmt`.
- `UntilMod` and `WhileMod` nodes that wrap a `Begin` should be forced into their modifier forms.
- Ensure `For` loops keep their trailing commas.
- Replicate content for `__END__` keyword exactly.
- Keep block `If`, `Unless`, `While`, and `Until` forms if there is an assignment in the predicate.
- Force using braces if the block is within the predicate of a conditional or loop.
- Allow for the possibility that `CommandCall` nodes might not have arguments.

### Removed

- The `AccessCtrl` node in favor of just formatting correctly when you hit a `Statements` node.
